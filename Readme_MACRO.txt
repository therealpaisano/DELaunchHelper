DOOM Eternal Macro v1.2
==========================
A speedrunning-intended macro for DOOM Eternal that allows you to spam inputs without a freescroll mouse.


Downloading and installing
==========================
Start the game, then run the executable.

bindings.txt
============
The default bindings for this macro include the "middle mouse button" for "spam mousewheel down" & "X2 mouse button (side button)" for "spam mousewheel up". If you don't like using these specific keys you can change them in bindings.txt. This file has the following format: <key code down> <key code up> or <key code> <mousewheel direction>.

For a list of possible key codes see the following link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes

When using the second format variant, it defaults to "Down" if no direction is specified.

Here are some examples:

Bind "middle mouse button" to "spamming wheel down" & "X2 mouse button" to "spamming wheel up". Use:
- 0x04 0x06

Bind "middle mouse button" to "spamming wheel down". Use either:
- 4
- 0x04
- 0x04 Down

Bind "middle mouse button" to "spamming wheel up". Use:
- 0x04 Up

To activate the macro in-game, just hold down the respective key for as long as necessary. The macro will continuously spam inputs, just as a freescroll mousewheel that you would keep spinning.

Is this allowed in speedruns?
=============================
Currently all DOOM Eternal speedrun categories on the official leaderboard (https://www.speedrun.com/doom_eternal) allow this macro to be used. This is to level the playing field as quite a few glitches strongly benefit from using a freescroll mousewheel.
